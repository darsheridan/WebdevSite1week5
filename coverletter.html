				<br/>
				<p>To whom it may concern,
				My name is Darragh Sheridan. 
				I wish to be considered for the position of Chief Software Engineer, as I feel that my qualities would suit the job.
				A life long user of software developer, I am aware of the value of the social & cultural services that software provide to all.
				I would be excited to be a part of this  . The innovative shift in service delivery (particularly over the last year) is especially interesting.
				I am experienced at working in fast paced, changeable environments as part of a team, both in my employment in Specialty Coffee & through my education in the disciplines of Product Design & UX Design. Strong communication & the ability to work in a team are essential. 
				In my time in education as a secondary school supervisor I was able to manage & deal with diverse and often   challenging groups. 
				I have a broad and in-depth IT skills base, having studied UX (interface design), with a grasp for website design, website building, graphic design, social media management & branding. I possess a good knowledge of the Adobe and MS Suite. 
				I am highly motivated, with self initiative and interest in alway upskilling myself. 
				I would be delighted for the opportunity to be a part of the Software Development service & would be grateful if you could view my CV.
